# Todo-list

Project Main Goals
- use modules and webpack
    - use export and import
- Use local storage
    - Save current array of user's todo so it maintains the same between page loads

Things to do that I have not done
- Set up date-fns
    - make it so it adds dates to the item
    - Check if a new day has come and soft refresh the daily activities
        - Soft refresh, items that were not completed the day before could be yellow to show it was missed.

Things to finish that I have done in the past, but rather further education and move on.
- Style project more
    - Visually more appealing 
    - Make to do boxes into separate lines, not cards
- Make projects/bills/yet to be completed work
    - Just copy daily over and adjust code for each category
- Make it so users can create their own categories
    - Adds it to drop down menu as well
- When done/not done clicked it will switch
    - updates to local as well
- Add delete button to the item on the list
    - Scans through array for the title
    - Make it so the title has to be unique
